# Advent-of-code-2020

Combined code repository for Advent of Code 2020, All done in C++.

Each folder contains typically a file "input" which the individual input is put into, and then either main.cpp, p2.cpp or a combination of both.

This code was not written with the main intention of being reusable or well documented, but done with the intentions of competetive programming.
